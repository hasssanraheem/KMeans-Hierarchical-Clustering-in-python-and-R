# KMeans-Hierarchical-Clustering-in-python-and-R
Clustering Models in Python & R

This repository contains implementations of two widely used unsupervised clustering techniques: K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering.
Each model is organized in its own folder with:

A dedicated script in Python and R

Sample datasets for demonstration

Instructions for running and visualizing the clustering results

Models Included

K-Means Clustering – Partitions data into k clusters using iterative optimization.

Hierarchical Clustering – Builds a hierarchy of clusters using agglomerative or divisive methods.
